# Vercel AI Integration

Augment your Generative User Interfaces with web-browsing capabilities.

## Introduction

Vercel is the leading platform to develop and deploy front-end applications.

With the rise of AI applications built around chat interfaces, Vercel released the Vercel AI SDK to help build smooth chat-based front-end experiences and experiment with multiple models on the back-end with Serverless Functions.

Vercel's Generative User Interface lets developers stream components directly to the front end, unlocking AI experiences beyond text-based chats.

Browserbase is a perfect addition to the Vercel AI SDK, bringing headless browser support to Serverless applications.

## Examples

In this directory we have two examples of using Vercel & Browserbase together:

BrowseGPT is a chat interface that allows users to search the web and get answers to their questions. It demonstrates how to use Vercel AI SDK with Browserbase to create an AI assistant that can browse the web in real-time to provide up-to-date information.

The second example shows how to use Puppeteer with Vercel on Fluid Compute. It demonstrates setting up a Next.js application with Puppeteer for browser automation tasks, deployed on Vercel's Fluid Compute infrastructure which provides longer execution times needed for browser automation.
