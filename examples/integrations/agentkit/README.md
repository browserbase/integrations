# AgentKit

## Using AgentKit with Browserbase

Develop AI Agents that can browse the web autonomously using Browserbase and AgentKit (by inngest).

## Overview

By the end of this guide, you'll have an AI agent built with AgentKit that can browse the web using Browserbase.

### You'll learn how to:

- Create AgentKit tools that leverage Browserbase's managed headless browsers
- Build autonomous web browsing agents that can search, extract data, and interact with websites 
- Use Stagehand, Browserbase's AI-powered browser automation library, to create resilient web agents

### This integration is useful for:

- Building AI agents that can fetch real-time information from the web
- Creating autonomous browsing capabilities within your agents
- Developing resilient web scraping and interaction systems
- Enabling your agents to perform complex web-based tasks

### Integration Approaches

There are two approaches to using Browserbase with AgentKit:

1. **Create custom Browserbase tools**: Ideal for simple actions on webpages with manual browser control
2. **Use Stagehand library as tools**: Better for autonomous browsing and resilient web scraping

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- AgentKit installed
- Browserbase Project ID & API key  
- (Optional) LLM API key of your choice to use with Stagehand

Next, let's dive into building web browsing agents with AgentKit and Browserbase.
